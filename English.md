🏡 M's Tamatsukuri — Your Ideal Urban Stay in Osaka with Comfort, Convenience, and Style
If it’s your first time in Osaka and you're looking for a cozy, hassle-free place to stay without having to worry about garbage disposal rules—
If you’re traveling with family and need a safe, spacious space with sunlight, a kitchen, and room for everyone to rest—
Or if you’re here short-term for business, study, or events and you’re tired of overpriced hotel meals and boxed rooms,
Then the guest rooms on the 3rd and 4th floors of M's Tamatsukuri may be exactly what you're looking for.

✅ Prime Location: Central Osaka, where mobility is effortless
M’s Tamatsukuri is located at 1-4-7, Tamatsukuri, Higashi Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, 537-0024—a four-story building with a clean, functional design. It’s just a 3-minute walk from both JR Osaka Loop Line Tamatsukuri Station and Subway Nagahori-Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line Exit 3.
Whether you’re heading to Shinsaibashi for shopping, to Tennoji for exhibitions, to Umeda for work, or catching a train to Kansai Airport, you can reach your destination directly with minimal transfers and zero stress.

🛍️ Complete Urban Access: Convenience stores, supermarkets, breakfast shops—everything’s nearby
Step outside and you’ll find everything you need: 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, the large LIFE supermarket, bakeries, bento shops, drugstores, and vending machines—all within walking distance.
Whether it’s a hot coffee before your morning train, a cold beer before bed, or ingredients for a homemade dinner, daily errands are easy and quick.
You’re not adjusting to Osaka's pace—you’re living by your own rhythm.

🌤️ Rare Sunlight: 4-way ventilation + oversized windows—light all day long
Each guest room is around 30m², with a functional, open layout. Even more rare, the rooms are north-south oriented with windows on all four sides, totaling five large windows, each over 1 meter x 1 meter—larger than those found in many standalone houses in Japan.
You’ll wake to natural light, read and work without switching on the lights, and enjoy a warm, sun-filled space even in winter.
Such exceptional daylight and airflow are hard to come by—perfect for those who love bright, healthy living environments.

🛋️ Fully Equipped: A space ready to live, not just sleep
M’s Tamatsukuri is equipped for long-term stays and short visits alike. Each room includes:

High-speed Wi-Fi: Ideal for remote work, streaming, and video calls

Air conditioning (heating & cooling): Comfortable in all seasons

Washing machine + drying rod and hangers: No need for laundromats

Compact kitchen + 90L refrigerator: Cook your own meals and store groceries

Durable flooring: Made of cushioned vinyl, it’s resilient, safe, and comfortable for families with kids or the elderly

Cleaning tools included: Electric vacuum cleaner, mattress vacuum, and static broom

Professional weekly cleaning: Deep cleans included, so the room always stays fresh and sanitary

🖼️ Artful Interiors: Thoughtfully curated style and atmosphere
Each floor has its own artistic personality:

The 3rd floor features world-renowned artworks, including Vincent van Gogh’s Café Terrace at Night and The Starry Night—vibrant and expressive, perfect for creative spirits

The 4th floor is decorated with pastoral and countryside scenes, offering a gentle, serene mood for those seeking rest and tranquility

Art isn’t just decoration—it defines the soul of the room, transforming the space into a calming, living gallery.

🗑️ Freedom of Disposal: Private garbage bin, 24/7 trash access
One of the biggest pain points for travelers in Japan? Trash sorting and disposal rules. Burnables on Monday only? Bottles must be rinsed and bagged? Miss the time, wait three days?
Not here. M's Tamatsukuri has its own private garbage bin downstairs, available 24/7 for all types of household waste (except large furniture).
This means no sorting stress, no time restrictions, and no awkwardness about doing it “wrong.” It’s true freedom for daily living, rare even by local standards.

🧳 Who is this perfect for?
International travelers: Language barriers? No problem. Life here is plug-and-play.

Families with kids: Spacious, quiet, full kitchen, and safe flooring—easy to settle in

Remote workers or freelancers: Fast Wi-Fi, good lighting, and comfortable furniture

Couples or friends: Share a space, cook together, enjoy privacy when needed

Short-term students/interns: Feels like home, with all the benefits of the city nearby

Whether you’re staying 3 nights, 3 weeks, or 3 months, M’s Tamatsukuri provides the flexibility, comfort, and environment to make Osaka truly feel like yours.

🎯 M's Tamatsukuri: More than a stay. It's a better way to live in Osaka.
In a city as fast-paced and stimulating as Osaka, M’s Tamatsukuri offers not just a guest room, but a multi-purpose lifestyle space.
Enjoy handmade dumplings, Cantonese BBQ, and ginger tea from the Hong Kong restaurant on the first floor.
Refresh your look at the hair salon on the second.
